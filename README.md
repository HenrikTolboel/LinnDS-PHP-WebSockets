# LinnDS-PHP-WebSockets
Control your Linn DS streamer from Your web browser. A simple menu system traverse Your music collection that is placed as files inside 
a simple http server. Music is played from Your web browser on any device (utilising jquery mobile framework). A simple daemon client 
talks to the Linn DS device via the LPEC protocol.

The web client talks to the daemon via websockets.

The complete setup is written in PHP and Javascript / HTML5.

This is shareware - use at own risk :-)

In my eyes, music playing via this is much simpler than using e.g. Linn Kazoo, that needs a third party server. My setup runs on a synology NAS, but i suppose any NAS utilising http server and PHP will work.
